VIEWS
virtual table created on top of a real table.
stores the result answer as a fake table so there is no need for us to execute 
the complex query again and again.
syntax:
create or replace view viewname as (my real query);

create or replace view custordr_view as (select c.cust_id, o.cust_id from 
customer c, orders o where c.cust_id=o.cust_id);

select * from custordr_view; (equi join of custormer and orders table)

select name from custordr_view where prodname='iphone';

Guidelines:
1. We cannot insert , update or delete a view data.
2. if we want view data to be updated we need to do changes to the main table.
3. changes done in the view area of the main table will affect the view.
changes done to the non view area of the main table will not affect the view.
