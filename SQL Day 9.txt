SUBQUERY -> answer that cant be obtained with one query can be achieved with subquery.
you can use subquery for one table.

Employee-> names, age, details...
max age irkaravangaloda details venum:
//select max(age),* from tn;
//select * from tn where age=max(age);

---->     select* from tn where age =(select max(age) from tn ) ORDER BY NAME;
----> select * from tn where salary in (select salary from tn2 where salary>1500) order by name;


DONT USE ORDER BY INSIDE SUBQUERY!

Query inside a Query.

select * from task_table where id = 
|
main Query

(select id from employee_table where phno = '1983109121');
|
subquery

select colmn from table where anycol operator (subquery)

1. A main query can have many subqueries.
2. subquery can return only one column.
3. Subquery should be written inside brackets only.
4. Subquery is always placed in right of main query.
5. Write the third subquery inside 2nd subquery.
main query where col >(subquery1 where col = (Subquery2 (())))

Types of Subquery:
Single row SubQuery (<,>,<=,>=,<>,=)
Multiple row subquery(IN, NOT IN, >ANY,=ANY,<ANY, >ALL,<ALL,=ALL)

MAINQUERY WHERE OPERATOR(SUBQUERY);
			|	       |
	=,<,>,<=,>=,<>,IN,ANY,ALL	SingleRow/Multiple row

task_table,Employee_table

select * from task_table where ID = 
MQ			OPERATOR
(select ___ID___ from employee_table where name='A')
SQ

NAME A LA ---> 1 ROW   ---> SRSQ

select status in task_t where id in (select id from employee_t where name in (SQ)) and task in (SQ);

select * from task_table where ID in

1. Subquery returns 1 row 1 column - Single Row SubQuery
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE_TABLE WHERE ID = (SELECT ID FROM TASK TABLE WHERE ID =2);
2	B	23242498	2020-02-04
2. Subquery returns many rows 1 column - Multiple row subquery
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE_TABLE WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM TASK TABLE);
3. Subquery la select panirka column, main query la where condition la irkanum.
4. Dont use * in subquery  because subquery will not return many columns.
