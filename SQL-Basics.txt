SQL - 5 Subsets - DDL + DML + DQL + DCL + TCL = SQL
DDL - Data Definition Language

DDL Commands - CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
Why? Structure - What are the column name, Datatypes, Conditions of column and its modifications like 
Renaming the table, renaming columns, 
Deleting a column, inserting a column, adding conditions to the column.

DML- Data Modification Language
DML Commands - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
DML will modify the table rows. Ex: Add data to the cells, change row data, delete row data. 

DQL - Data Query Language
DQL Commands - SELECT, SHOW, HELP
DQL will fetch the data according to the questions/Queries asked to the table.
Ex. 1 Lakh column,1 lakhs rows -  very tedious to understand the table.
DQL will help us in fetching/ Retrieve the contents upon the query asked.

DCL - Data Control Language
DCL Commands- GRANT, REVOKE
Ex: Data Administrator - allow and not allow the persons who can view the data.
In a company, you are joining as a new employee- credentials given - Allowed granted permission to view their contents.
In a company, you are releiving from there - credentials are removed - you are denied or revoked permissions to view their contents.


TCL - Transaction Control Language
TCL Commands - COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
Ex: ATM - Taking money
1. yur account has balance & atm has money - you will be able to take money. 1 Transaction. COMMIT.

Word File - We write some contents.
CTRL+S - SAVEPOINT - for safety purpose - what if something goes wrong? i wanted to save my data properly.
CTRL+Z - ROLLBACK -undo the wrong workings.
